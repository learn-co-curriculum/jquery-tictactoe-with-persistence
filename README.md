# jQuery Tic-Tac-Toe with Persistence

## About

In the first jQuery tic-tac-toe lab, you had to only keep track of the state of the most current game.

This time you'll have to keep track of the game that was most recently played. When someone wins, or ties, you should save the state of the game.  We're not going to tell you how to do this. This SHOULD be hard and you might have to do some "hacky" stuff to get it to work.

## Test Suite

Feel free to use the code you already wrote for jQuery Tic-Tac-Toe to pass the first seven tests.

The new tests this time only test that there's a button I can click that will pop up a view of the state of the board at the end of last game. We're intentionally not going to guide or test HOW you implement that functionality.
